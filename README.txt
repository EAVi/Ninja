    This project was begun on 25 Aug, 2016 and has been worked on on/off since. 
    As of 27 September, 2017, this project is ~3800 lines of code (and 1300 lines of comments/spacing)
    
    I've tested the files in both Windows, Debian. You'll need to download the 
    SDL2, SDL2-image, and SDL2-mixer libraries in order to compile.

    To run on Raspberry Pi, download and enable the latest OpenGL drivers.
