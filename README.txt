    This project was begun on 25 Aug, 2016 and has been worked on on/off since. 
    As of 22 October, 2017, this project is ~4400 lines of code (and 1500 lines of comments/spacing)

    SDL2, SDL2-image, and SDL2-mixer libraries in order to compile.

    To run on Raspberry Pi, download and enable the latest OpenGL drivers.
