    This project was begun on 25 Aug, 2016 and has been worked on on/off since. 
    As of 29 August, 2017, this project is ~3500 lines of code (and 1000 lines of comments/spacing)
    
    I've tested the files in both Windows, Debian. You'll need to download the 
        SDL2, SDL2-image, and SDL2-mixer libraries in order to compile.
